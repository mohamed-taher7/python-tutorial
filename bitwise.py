operators   name  description
&         	AND 	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
|        	  OR 	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
 ^ 	        XOR 	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~       	  NOT 	Inverts all the bits
<<       	  Zero fill left shift 	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
>>      	  Signed right shift 	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
